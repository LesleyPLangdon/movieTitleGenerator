// ðŸ§ª Mini-Challenge 1: Roll for Traits
/* 
    Basic: Ask user to hit enter to trigger the rollTraits() function for each trait.
    The function should determine a random value for the level of Action, Romance, and Weirdness the film includes
    Return the values in an associative array with the trait as the key/
*/
/*
    Challenge: Use themed ranges. Base your trait ranges on numbers that relate to the trait. For example, my output asking the user to roll for Action says:
        echo "\nThe action movie genre spans wildly different subgenres â€” from espionage thrillers to sci-fi blockbusters.";
        echo "\nThere were 6 James Bond films starring the best Bond (Sean Connery, of course).";
        echo "\nMeanwhile, a DeLorean had to hit 88 mph to send Marty McFly *Back to the Future*.";
        readline("\nHit Enter to roll your movie's Action Level (between 6 and 88): ");

    I used "Rom-Com", "Absurdist Horror", and "Slice of Life Documentary". You are free to select other genres.

        I used "Unbelievable", "Mysterious", "Explosive", "Romantic", and "Weird" for adjectives and 
        "Revenge", "Adventure", "Love Story", "Conspiracy", and "Saga" for nouns but you are free to select your own words
    The variable names for the arrays should be "adjectives" and "nouns".

/*
    Display the final movie summary based on tone
    Include details like title, hero, traits, genre, setting, twist, and sidekick
    Use if/elseif or switch to display based on tone (epic, silly, dark, or default fallback)

    My summary for an epic movie looks like this but your are free to be as creative as you would like:

        echo "\nBut beware... {$movie['twist']}\n";
