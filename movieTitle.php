// 🧪 Mini-Challenge 1: Roll for Traits
/* 
    Basic: Ask user to hit enter to trigger the rollTraits() function for each trait.
    The function should determine a random value for the level of Action, Romance, and Weirdness the film includes
    Return the values in an associative array with the trait as the key/
*/
/*
    Challenge: Use themed ranges. Base your trait ranges on numbers that relate to the trait. For example, my output asking the user to roll for Action says:
        echo "\nThe action movie genre spans wildly different subgenres — from espionage thrillers to sci-fi blockbusters.";
        echo "\nThere were 6 James Bond films starring the best Bond (Sean Connery, of course).";
        echo "\nMeanwhile, a DeLorean had to hit 88 mph to send Marty McFly *Back to the Future*.";
        readline("\nHit Enter to roll your movie's Action Level (between 6 and 88): ");

    I used "Rom-Com", "Absurdist Horror", and "Slice of Life Documentary". You are free to select other genres.

/*
    Create an indexed array with at least three settings for your movie
    Display the options using a loop and ask the user to select one
    I used "Space Diner", "Underwater Castle", "Mini Golf Course" but you are free to select your own settings

        "a talking taxidermy owl" for "Absurdist Horror", 
        "their overly helpful neighbor who always carries snacks" for "Slice of Life Documentary",

/*
    Generate a ridiculous movie title by combining two random words with genre and setting
    Create two arrays: one with at least 5 adjectives and one with at least 5 nouns. 
        I used "Unbelievable", "Mysterious", "Explosive", "Romantic", and "Weird" for adjectives and 
        "Revenge", "Adventure", "Love Story", "Conspiracy", and "Saga" for nouns but you are free to select your own words
    The variable names for the arrays should be "adjectives" and "nouns".
    Randomly select one adjective and one noun and assign them to variables named adjective and noun.

// 🧪 Mini-Challenge 7: Print Full Summary
/*
    Display the final movie summary based on tone
    Include details like title, hero, traits, genre, setting, twist, and sidekick
    Use if/elseif or switch to display based on tone (epic, silly, dark, or default fallback)

    My summary for an epic movie looks like this but your are free to be as creative as you would like:
        echo "🔥 In a tale of grand destiny, {$movie['hero']} must brave the {$movie['setting']} with {$movie['sidekick']} by their side.";
        echo "\nThis {$movie['genre']} features Action: {$movie['traits']['Action']}, Romance: {$movie['traits']['Romance']}, Weirdness: {$movie['traits']['Weirdness']}.";
        echo "\nBut beware... {$movie['twist']}\n"; 
    You can also take a more straight forward aproach simply putting all of the collected information into a logical, readable string.
