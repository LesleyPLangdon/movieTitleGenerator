# ðŸŽ¥ Ridiculous Movie Title & Summary Generator

You're going to build this generator **one function at a time**. Each function matches a mini-challenge in your project.

---

## âœ… Your Goals

- Focus on **one function/mini-challenge** at a time.
- Use `echo` to test that each function works **before moving on**.
- Use the example outputs or create your own â€” **creativity counts, but only if your code works!**
- Get it working first, then go back and add funny, weird, or dramatic twists.

---

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Start at the **top of your file**.
2. Complete **each mini-challenge** in order.
3. After finishing each function:
   - âœ… Make sure your code runs without errors.
   - âœ… Print out your result to check that itâ€™s working.
4. Once it works, move on to the next challenge.

At the end, youâ€™ll have a **fully generated ridiculous movie summary** â€” ready to pitch to Hollywood!

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- Use `readline()` to get input from the user.
- Use `rand()` to generate random numbers.
- Use `switch`, `if/else`, `arrays`, and `functions` like weâ€™ve practiced.
